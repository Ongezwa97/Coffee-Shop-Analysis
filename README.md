Despite having a consistent stream of transactional data, Bright Coffee Shop has not yet implemented a structured approach to monitor store-level performance and identify top/bottom performers and track customer purchasing trends over time. As a result, opportunities for revenue growth, store improvement, and customer satisfaction are being missed.
